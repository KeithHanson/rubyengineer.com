      PAGES & EXPLANATION!
      **************************************************
      
      Each page is aproximately 480px tall. I have no idea what that equates out to in text cut off, but if you get past that
      we get scroll bars. Thats the suck. So each post will have page 1 / 2 / 3 / etc. You'll have two classes. Left page, right page. 
      I've built the JS to ajax out to the posts folder (you fill in the variable) and grab the next set of pages. 
      It just walks the DOM and grabs the element on the back of the request. The markup is identical to the visible markup, this is just
      the poor mans JSON. 
      
      You'll just have to play with the content to see how its coming out and where to split the pages. =\
      
      The left / right classing handles positioning.
      
      You've also got markup you can put in the blogs. H1 - H6, IMG (Wide, Left, and Right), UL, OL, and Code hilighting with BeautyOfCode.

        This contains all my candid thoughts on software development and various other topics
        pertaining to the realm of delivering quality software. You may or may not agree with them, but they are mine
        and what I have found to generally be true over the years of my development life. 
      </h4>
      <p>
        Often, I will try to keep my customers in mind when speaking about new technologies and development "practices", 
        but every now and then I'll let the inner geek loose and speak about developer specific ideas. Ultimately, though,
        my goal is to help the non-developer understand topics that will help them make more informed decisions 
        about their choices of technologies, practices, and platforms.
